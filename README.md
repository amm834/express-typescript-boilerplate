# Express and Typescript Boilerplate

Most of the time, I used to `ts-node` and `nodemon` for my **Typescript** + **Express** development.
But, web bundler were evolved especially the speed of compile time which reduces uncomfortable **Developer Experience**.
Hence, I decided
to
change my development workflow to speed up with  `ESbuild` which is
the successor of **Webpack** in **2022** which change the bundler world. This project is just a demo boilerplate which
uses `ESBuild` to speed up my workflow.
